    <h2>A <a href="http://rust-lang.org">Rust</a> meetup in Brooklyn, NYC.</h2>
    <hr>

    <h3>No talks, just code.</h3>
    <p>I mean, we'll talk to each other and stuff. Just nothing fancy. Come get together with other people interested in Rust. It'll be a good time.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Once a month, we meet up and have fun with Rust.</li>
      <li>Anyone and everyone can come. For serious. <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/wiki/Note-development-policy#conduct">We follow the Rust code of conduct</a>.</li>
      <li>Heck, if you don't know Rust, come too. We'll show you.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>That's cool, but when and where?</h3>
    <p>We're still figuring this out, but the first one will be on Saturday, June 21, 2014, at <a href="https://www.brooklynroasting.com/cafe">Brooklyn Roasting Company</a> at 25 Jay Street, 11201, at 1PM.</p>
    <p>Weekends aren't as good for meetups, usually, so this will probably change in the future. Saturday afternoon hacking with friends is special to me, though, so the first one will be a Saturday. I'm thinking a Monday at <a href="http://www.61local.com/index.html">61 Local</a> in the future.</p>

    <h3>Who runs this show?</h3>
    <p>Hello. *waves*. I'm <a href="http://steveklabnik.com">Steve</a>. You may have read my <a href="http://www.rustforrubyists.com">Rust for Rubyists</a> tutorial. I like Rust, I live in Brooklyn, there wasn't a Rust meetup. Classic fairytale story.</p>
